**Introduction:**
Quantitative finance, a relatively novel approach to investing, relies on systemic processes to make decisions on which 
assets to purchase for maximum profitability in a given market. Such algorithms are powerful as they (partially) remove 
the need for human intervention, often a significant source of losses and volatility. In the realm of quantitative 
finance, developing and implementing a robust investment strategy is crucial. One such approach, detailed in the 
book "Quantitative Momentum: A Practitioner's Guide to Building a Momentum-Based Stock Selection System," focuses on 
harnessing momentum to select winning stocks. This summary outlines the core concepts of the momentum strategy, its 
empirical basis, and the backtesting framework I've developed to evaluate its performance. In order to test the viability 
of a Momentum Strategy, as described by Wesley R. Gray and Jack R. Vogel, the following backtesting engine was developed.

**Data and Development:**
Paramount to a successful evaluation of a strategy is data. This project utilizes OHLC data over 8500 equities 
spanning decades of trade history sourced from Stooq. To clean the data, we deleted any empty files, converted 
from text to CSV, filled in missing data points, and otherwise prepared the information in a format that could 
be analyzed. We stored all the data in SQLite for management and querying.

**Strategy Overview:**
The momentum strategy involves capitalizing on the tendency of stocks that have performed well in the past to continue 
performing well in the future. This principle underpins the "buying winners" philosophy, where the strategy sorts stocks 
based on their past returns and constructs portfolios accordingly. The key idea is that behavioral biases, market frictions, 
and career risk create mispriced opportunities that can be exploited systematically.

**Execution**
This analysis was designed to remove as many biases as possible. To avoid lookahead bias, our software only makes decisions after the market close 
(so if making trading decisions for 1/2, all decisions would have been decided on the night of 1/1). Since our dataset lacks order book analytics, 
we simulated trading costs and other market friction costs by charging an extra 1% from market opens the next day. Even with the attention paid to 
possible artificial performance boosts, there are some limitations a user should be aware of. Due to cost constraints, the backtester does not have 
access to survivorship bias-free data, so delisted equities were not tested.
