## Strategy Parameters

**Look back period**: How long ago to judge a stock's generic momenutm. Generic momentum
is defined as the absolute return of an equity over that time period. 

**Lottery Window**: The 'lottery' bias of the market is the human tendency to overestimate 
the likelihood of slim odds. This means that stocks the market overvalues high risk high reward 
equities, therby leaving less investment capital for the steadier more consistent tickers. Our strategy
utilizes this by measuring what percent of the days in the lottery window time period were positive for the 
stock. 

**Firms Held**: The maximum number of equities our strategy will hold at a time 

**Rebalance Frequency**: How often we rebalance the portfolio 

When constructing or rebalancing a portfolio, the strategy first sorts all equities in our database by their generic momentum (absolute return over look back period)
over the look back period and selects the top 10%. The strategy will then organize the equities by their FIP score, calculated by
 ```Generic Momentum * (Percent Positive Days - Percent Negative Days)``` for relevant periods and evenly distributes capital into 
the top stocks held, building a maxium sized portfolio decided by the parameters.
