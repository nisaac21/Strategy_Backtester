**Introduction:**
Quantitative finance, a relativly novel approach to investing, relies on systemic processes in order to make decision on which 
assets to purchase for maximum profitability in a given market. Such algorithms are powerful as they (partially) remove the need
for human intervention, an often significant source of losses and volatility. In the realm of quantitative finance, developing and implementing a robust investment strategy is crucial. 
One such approach, detailed in the book "Quantitative Momentum: A Practitioner's Guide to 
Building a Momentum-Based Stock Selection System," focuses on harnessing momentum to select winning stocks. 
This summary outlines the core concepts of the momentum strategy, its empirical basis, and the backtesting framework 
I've developed to evaluate its performance. In order to test the viability of a Momentum Strategy, as described 
by Wesley R. Gray and Jack R. Vogel the following backtesting engine was developed

**Data and Development:**
Paramount to a succesful evaluation of a strategy is data. This project utilizes OHLC data over 8500 equities 
spanning decades of trade history sourced from Stooq. To clean the data we deleted any empty files, converted from text to csv, 
filled in missing data points, and otherwise prepared the information in a format that could be analyzed. We stored all the data 
in SQLite for management and querying. 

**Strategy Overview:**
The momentum strategy involves capitalizing on the tendency of stocks that have performed well in the past to continue 
performing well in the future. This principle underpins the "buying winners" philosophy, where the strategy sorts stocks 
based on their past returns and constructs portfolios accordingly. The key idea is that behavioral biases, market frictions, 
and career risk create mispriced opportunities that can be exploited systematically.

The strategy has the following parameters...

Look back period: How long ago to judge a stock's generic momenutm. Generic momentum
is defined as the absolute return of an equity over that time period. 

Lottery Window: The 'lottery' bias of the market is the human tendency to overestimate 
the likelihood of slim odds. This means that stocks the market overvalues high risk high reward 
equities, therby leaving less investment capital for the steadier more consistent tickers. Our strategy
utilizes this by measuring what percent of the days in the lottery window time period were positive for the 
stock. 

Firms Held: The maximum number of equities our strategy will hold at a time 

Rebalance frequency: How often we rebalance the portfolio 

When constructing or rebalancing a portfolio, the strategy first sorts all equities in our database by their generic momentum
over the look back period and selects the top 10%. The strategy will then organize the equities by their FIP score, calculated by
$Generic Momentum * (Percent Positive Days - Percent Negative Days)$ for relevant periods and evenly distributes capital into 
the top stocks held, building a maxium sized portfolio decided by the parameters. 

**Execution**
This analysis was designed to remove as many biases as possible. To avoid lookahead bias, our software only makes decisions after the market close
(so if making trading decisions for 1/2 all decisions would have been decided on 1/1 night). Since our dataset lacks orderbook analytics, 
we simulated trading costs and other market friction costs by charging an extra 1% from market opens the next day. Even with 
the attention paid to possible artificial performance boosts, there are some limitations a user should be aware of. Due to cost 
constraints, the backtester does not have access to survivorship bias free data, so delisted equities were not tested.
